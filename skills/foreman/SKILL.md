# Foreman — the boss never implements

The one-sentence version: the orchestrating agent (the boss) writes the spec and the constitution, staffs implementation on cheaper seats, verifies blind, rules on disputes — and never implements. Done right, the boss does *more* judging, not less.

## When to load

- Any arc with **≥ ~3 independent implementation units** (files, endpoints, fixtures, migrations, assets — units a worker can own end-to-end).
- Any **grindable, oracle-covered** build — even a single big unit — where retry-until-green is safe (cheap deterministic re-runs, no side effects per attempt).

When NOT to: single-file hands-on work (the org chart has overhead); intent-heavy prose (voice belongs to the human — it never gets delegated); ungrindable work where each attempt touches the world (rate limits, live sends, one-shot state) — that stays on the human cadence, no worker loops.

## Seats and pools

Speak in seats and tiers, not personalities. A **seat** is a named role bound to a specific model and dispatch recipe; a **pool** is the budget it draws from.

| Seat | Role | Never does |
|---|---|---|
| **Boss** (the orchestrating/session model) | Spec, constitution, dispatch, dispute rulings, final full-context integration review | Implement. Not "rarely" — never. The moment the boss writes the code, the economics invert. |
| **Reasoning seat** (strongest worker tier) | Hard-reasoning units (concurrency, algorithms, gnarly refactors); shepherd-review of a risky merge | Bulk work the bulk tier can do |
| **Bulk seat** (capable mid tier) | Default implementer AND bulk work (ports, fixtures, renames, test authoring, checker duty) | — |
| **External seats** (your roster) | Per their audition scores — dispatch recipes live with the roster | Join without an audition |

**The gotcha that motivates this table:** subagent dispatches typically **inherit the session model unless a model is set explicitly** — an unstaffed fan-out runs N boss-priced workers, the exact opposite of the point. Every worker dispatch names its seat's model explicitly. On a subscription plan the saving is measured in boss-share of weighted usage rather than dollars; it is still the binding constraint.

## The five moves

**1. Constitution first.** Before any dispatch, write the done-right standard: 5–15 *checkable* points, each naming its oracle where one exists (the test suite, the linter, a smoke count, exact file layout, banned patterns). The constitution is not the spec — the spec says what to build, the constitution says how everyone (worker, checker, boss) will know it's right. It goes **verbatim** into every worker and every checker prompt. Prompt the standard once; never steer task-by-task.

**2. Staff explicitly.** Pick seats from the table; say the staffing out loud in the green-light message ("6 units → bulk-seat workers, the reasoning seat on the scheduler unit, bulk-seat checkers, oracle = the smoke suite"). Boss-implemented units = zero.

**3. Dispatch = spec + constitution + oracle name.** Each worker gets its unit's spec, the constitution verbatim, and the name of the oracle that will judge it. Workers return artifacts (or write to assigned paths). Their self-report is for the boss's ledger only — checkers never see it.

**4. Blind verify.** Oracle first — deterministic, cheap, no judgment spent on what a script can catch. Then a **checker seat with fresh context** that receives the *artifact + constitution only* — never the worker's claims — and executes and measures: run it, refetch it, re-count it, screenshot it. Failures bounce back as **specific defects** ("test 7 fails: ParseRange(\"5-\") returns 5,0 want error"), not "try again." **Two bounces → a fresh worker**, not a third retry (entropy collapse: a worker marinating in its own failure converges on the same wrong idea).

**5. The foreman's report.** At arc close: units delegated, bounces, what the checkers caught, disputes ruled, and the estimated boss-share saved. What bounced and why is the interesting part — report it plainly.

## Merge trains end with a MAIN build oracle

Blind verify covers each PR — it does NOT cover the boss's own merge-conflict resolutions. On one all-night multi-arc run, every per-PR check was green while the boss's hand-stitched conflict resolution had dropped a single closing paren; the live deploy kept working off a pre-break image, and main sat unbuildable until a worker caught the foreman's own merge slip. The rule: after the LAST merge of a train, run the repo's build oracle against merged main itself (build, vet, or a CI dispatch) before declaring the train landed. The boss's fingers are the one worker no checker was watching — so the oracle watches them.

## Watch what you order

Review worker output against **intent, not just completion**. A green oracle proves the unit does what the constitution measured; only the boss's full-context read proves it does what the human meant. Two consequences:

- **The dispute rule — no rank above verification.** A worker may contest a checker's fail; the boss rules **on the spec**, both directions — a checker enforcing a rule the constitution never named gets corrected, same as a cheating worker. And the boss's own output (specs, designs, the constitution itself) goes through the same oracles. Nothing outranks the check.
- **The final integration review is real work.** A latent defect can pass build + vet + tests + a checker and still be wrong; the full-context review by the boss is the ceiling of the whole pattern. Budget for it — don't spend the boss's context implementing and then skip the one thing only the boss can do.

## Hiring — the audition oracle

**Never hire a model seat without an audition.** Every new seat passes a small, standardized, *paid* audition task before joining the roster; re-audition on any model or version bump. The audition is a spec-precision coding tryout judged by a **deterministic pass/fail checker**: table tests, compliance greps, and an examples block whose claims are *executed against a reference implementation*, not trusted. Scores and the exact dispatch recipe that worked go in the roster — the roster is data, and future staffing reads it instead of re-guessing.

## Ceilings — what this pattern cannot do

- **Delegation ceiling = oracle coverage.** No oracle over a unit → the boss reviews it by hand, or builds the oracle first. Widen delegation by widening the verification floor, not by trusting workers harder.
- **The full-context shepherd is the ceiling.** See "Watch what you order" — some defects are only visible to a reviewer holding the whole picture.
- **Intent stays the human's.** Anything touching voice, design taste, or strategy is surfaced, not delegated — the [human-in-the-loop](../human-in-the-loop/SKILL.md) bins apply unchanged.
